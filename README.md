# Authentication

## Description

**Authentication** is a **secure backend application** built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, designed to handle user authentication and access control with best security practices. It supports **user registration**, **login**, **secure password handling**, and **access to protected routes**. The system implements **Zod** for robust input validation, supports **hashed passwords**, and uses either **JWT (JSON Web Token)** or **session-based** authentication for flexible integration.

This backend is ideal for integration into full-stack applications to ensure only authorized users can access protected data and functionality.
